# Background

The PyBank and PyPoll Challenges involve analyzing financial and election data using Python scripts. In PyBank, the financial records of a company are analyzed to calculate metrics such as the total number of months, net total amount of profits/losses, average changes in profits/losses, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits. PyPoll focuses on analyzing poll data from a small, rural town to determine the total number of votes cast, list of candidates receiving votes, percentage and total number of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Methods

To perform the analysis, Python scripts are utilized. The financial data is stored in a CSV file named "budget_data.csv" for PyBank, while the poll data is stored in a CSV file named "election_data.csv" for PyPoll. The scripts utilize modules like csv to import and read the data from the respective CSV files. The data is then processed and analyzed using Python's data structures such as variables, lists, and dictionaries, along with iteration techniques.

For PyBank, the script calculates various financial metrics by iterating through the dataset, performing calculations, and storing the results. The final analysis is printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

Similarly, for PyPoll, the script analyzes the poll data by counting votes, calculating percentages, and determining the winner. The results are also printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

By using Python scripts instead of relying solely on Excel, the challenges showcase the power and flexibility of scripting for handling large datasets and performing more complex analyses.
